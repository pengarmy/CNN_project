# CNN_project
Image Classification In this project, you'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images. Get the Data Run the following cell to download the CIFAR-10 dataset for python (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz). Data CIFAR-10 is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.
